    "*The 2024 season was one of two halves. Max Verstappen and Red Bull dominated the first – winning seven of the first 10 Grands Prix – but then struggled in the second. In an incredibly competitive campaign, Mercedes, Ferrari and McLaren each saw both their drivers take multiple wins, but in the end no one could quite match Verstappen’s class, the Dutchman clinching a fourth consecutive drivers’ crown, as his nearest rival Lando Norris led McLaren to their first constructors’ championship since 1998.*\n",

    "[This](https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2025) is the schedule for the upcoming Formula 1 races for 2025: Australia is first on March 14, and then China on March 21.\n",

What is the Probability Distribution for each F1 driver to win *both* the Australia and China Grand Prix? What is the probability for Red Bull Honda to win both races? What is the probability for Red Bull Racing to win at least one race? Note that Red Bull Racing, and each other racing team, has two drivers per race, but sometimes drivers are replaced by reserve drivers, and so when you consider teams, you may have to consider more than 2 drivers. To simplify, assume the same Driver standings for the Australia and China Grand Prix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2** (20 points) If Red Bull Racing wins the Australia Grand Prix race, what is the probability that Red Bull Racing wins the China Grand Prix? If Red Bull Racing wins at least one of these two races, what is the probability Red Bull Racing wins both races? How about Ferrari, McLaren, and Aston-Martin? Assume the same Driver standings for the Australia and China Grand Prix.\n",

    "**Question 3** (20 points) Ferrari wins one of these two races on a sunny day. What is the probability Ferrari wins both races, assuming races can be held on either rainy, sunny, cloudy, snowy or foggy days, that these are the only possible weather conditions and that there is an equal probability for each? Assume the same Driver standings for the Australia and China Grand Prix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4** (30 points) Max Verstappen is committed by contract with Red Bull Racing to going to one fashion show in 2025. Assume there will be 10 fashion shows this year. If you commit to going to one fashion show as well, what is the probability you will meet Max there?\n",

    "You need to provide *proof* for your answers by using code, in the form of a function. `I think it's one in a million because Lewis and Ferrari is a winning combination`, or `fer sure Max wins because he rocks` are *not* good answers. Use our `p` probability function we worked on in class. Code the correct function predicates to pass to it. You need to write code that solves the problems."
